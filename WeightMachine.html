			<sectionHead>The Problem</sectionHead>
		
			I have always gone to the gym with a consistency somewhere between <i>never</i> and <i>how much I would like to go.</i> I can tell that  I lift quite a bit more weight than when I first started going in high school, but it's hard to tell if I've made much progress more recently. One time I was lifting some dumbbells and realized I had no idea how heavy the dumbbells were the last time I did that exercise. Nor could I remember how far I had run, or how fast, last time I had stepped on a treadmill.
			
			</br></br>
			
			I should start writing stuff down, I thought. Or maybe use one of those apps where you enter all the exercises you did and you can look at them later. But both of those would mean stopping my workout every minute or so to open my phone or notebook and put in some numbers. They were just too cumbersome - <i>I would never be able to do either of them consistently.</i>
			
			<img id="image" src="bla" alt="Is this even useful?">
			
			Then the thought came to me that maybe the gym, or rather, the gym's equipment, could track your exercises for you. After talking to a few people I knew and confirming that this wasn't just a problem for me, I decided it was worth looking into.
			
			<sectionHead>Prior Art</sectionHead>
			
			A lot of people have approached the problem of tracking exercises in a gym, and pretty much all of them can fit into a few categories:
			
			<ol>
				<li>The most ubiquitous (and least useful) solution are the apps I mentioned before, which basically function as digital notebooks where you write down everything you've done so you can look at it later. One example is JEFIT, which boasts on its website that it has over 3 Million registered users and over 15 Million logged workouts. It sounds impressive, until you realize that the average user has logged 5 workouts, meaning they used it for maybe 2 weeks before their motivation just couldn't overcome the nuisance of entering all their data. In fact, a study last year from NYU School of Medicine found that the number one reason people delete fitness-related smartphone apps is that it takes too long to enter their data.</li>
				<li>Probably inspired by the success of Fitbit and similar products, companies like <a id="link" href="http://www.gymwatch.com/en">Gymwatch</a> and <a id="link" href="http://www.atlaswearables.com">Atlas</a> have tried to create wearables that track detailed information about weight exercises, rather than more general data about steps or sleep. These things use some pretty amazing technology, but their capabilities seem a bit limited. They don't know how many pounds you're lifting, and devices like the Atlas wristband detects which exercise you're doing only if you tell it beforehand which ones you plan to do. Also, they're not cheap! Especially ones like <a id="link" href="http://www.liveathos.com">Athos.</a></li>
				<li>My initial thought was to outfit the gym itself with some high-tech equipment, and some companies have tried this approach. <a id="link" href="http://www.fitlinxx.net/fitlinxx-professional-tracking-devices.htm">Fitlinxx</a> attaches touchscreens to exercise equipment so users can enter an ID number and have their workouts recorded, but their product is old and the interface looks like Windows 98. Newer companies like <a id="link" href="http://www.eGym.com">eGym</a> have improved on this, but my more fundamental critique was that I didn't want to turn the gym into yet another place where screens are constantly in our faces. I wanted to use technology to track workouts but minimize the extent to which users are required to interact with that technology. </li>
			</ol>
			
			<sectionHead>Design Criteria</sectionHead>
			
			After researching more about the problem and talking to some gym managers and trainers, I was ready to start defining what a solution to this problem should look like:
			
			<ul>
				<li>Other than its staff and the land it occupies, a gym's most valuable asset is its equipment (or liability, since it is often leased). In any case, it typically has a value in the mid-six figures, and is difficult to replace both financially and logistically. For this reason, the product has to retrofit existing equipment, rather than selling a gym new equipment like <a id="link" href="http://www.technogym.com">TechnoGym</a>.</li>
				<li>My working theory, based on apps like JEFIT, was that each additional fraction of a second that a user has to spend interrupting their workout to capture data makes them much less likely to continue using the product. So I would have to be relentless in looking for any way to shave off a few milliseconds from the user experience. The vast majority of the time spent should be viewing and learning from their data, not collecting it.</li>
				<li>I knew that any hardware I designed wouldn't be easier to use than an iPhone or Galaxy, so why not make a product that is only used via a smartphone app and not interacted with physically by the user? It makes things simpler and means that the device doesn't have to look flashy, just do its job and communicate with smartphones. It also shouldn't require any additional wearable device to use, since those also have <a href="http://endeavourpartners.net/assets/Endeavour-Partners-Wearables-and-the-Science-of-Human-Behavior-Change-Part-1-January-20141.pdf" id="link">bad retention rates</a> and a host of potential problems with comfort, maintenance, and aesthetics, just to name a few.</li>
				<li>Finally, each new piece of outfitted equipment means one more device with one more battery. A gym staff can't be bothered with changing or charging batteries all the time, so they would need extremely low power consumption.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<sectionHead>Prototyping</sectionHead>
			<sectionHead class="sub">Narrowing the Focus</sectionHead>
			
			To begin to actually solve this problem, I distilled the job of this device down to four tasks: identify the exercise a person is doing, record how long they do it or the number of repetitions, measure any other relevant information (like the weight they are lifting), and transmit this data to their smartphone (and no one else's). For data transmission, I decided the best mechanism would be Bluetooth Low Energy, since it's pretty reliable, already built into smartphones, and it works well enough for Fitbit and a ton of other gadgets out there. Also, relatively inexpensive developer kits make it easy to learn and use. I picked up a few like <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/2829" id="link">this one from Adafruit</a> and within a week or two I was writing some pretty simple sketches and iOS apps to get my phone to communicate with them.
			
			</br></br>
			
			I quickly realized that the other three tasks, particularly exercise identification, were much more difficult. A few ideas popped into my head, like stationing some cameras at every piece of equipment and they could do everything. Maybe I could color code the weights to help the camera identify the weight, and use some amazing machine learning algorithms to identify exercises. I got a <a href="http://charmedlabs.com/default/pixy-cmucam5/" id="link">Pixy</a> and started tinkering with it, but I knew that actually implementing this was way beyond my capability and that it was also kind of creepy to put a bunch of cameras all over a gym.
			
			<img id="image" src="bla" alt="Pixy">
			
			Then I realized what my real problem was: I was trying to think of a catch-all solution for every exercise, when in fact exercises can be grouped into a few categories: cardio machines, select raise weight machines, barbells, and dumbbells. For equipment like dumbbells, identifying the exercise is very complicated, because the same dumbbells could be used for various exercises in any location. But for select raise weight machines, which use stacks of weighted plates and a pin to select how much weight you want to lift, the task is much simpler. Most machines can only be used for one type of exercise, and determining the weight is just a matter of counting the plates going up and down. It would be nice to have a single device that could retrofit any piece of equipment, but the reality was that using different technologies better suited to each type would be much more effective.
			
			</br></br>
			
			I decided that treadmills and select raise machines would be the easiest to track via retrofitting, and since wearables already do a pretty good job of tracking cardio exercises, I would focus on weight machines and the rest could come later.
						
			<sectionHead class="sub">Counting Plates</sectionHead>
			
			After choosing to focus on weight machine exercises, the four tasks became much simpler. Each device would be permanently attached to a single machine, so it would know from the start what exercise it was tracking. To count reps, I would use an accelerometer, a device that can measure change of direction. Wearables use them to count steps, but this would be easier because it involves more sudden change of direction (the weight plates moving vertically up and down). And I was slowly figuring out how to use Bluetooth for transmission. The only difficult task that remained was figuring out how much weight the person was lifting.
