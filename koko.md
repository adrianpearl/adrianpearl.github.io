KOKO is a project I worked on at Tomorrow Lab with <a id="link" href="http://www.imdarrien.com/">Darrien Tu</a>, focused on communication in long-distance relationships. For significant others that are far apart, digital technologies are better at replicating in-person interactions than in the past, but what they do not replace are the more subtle, nonverbal ways in which two people can communicate. KOKO aims to capture these in the form of two objects - one that lives with someone at home, and one that travels with their family member or significant other. The remote object senses different levels of the person's interaction with the object, which is transmited to the web, and the home object emits a corresponding tactile output. Is the remote person in the same room as the object? The home object lights up. Did they touch the object? The home object begins to vibrate. Did they pick it up? The home object becomes warm to the touch.

Throughout our design process, the guiding principle was that the scale of the input and output should be consistent. If the remote person is in the same room as their object, the home object's output should be noticeable at room-level. For a physical touch, the home object's output should only be detectable when it is also touched. This correspondence gives the users the intimate knowledge that they are both touching their devices simultaneously. The exclusivity of the device's purpose (in contrast to the limitless versatility of other digital communication devices) makes it unmistakable that when the device is used, the users are thinking only of each other.
