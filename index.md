## [Usage of Federal Tax Provisions](http://www.searchtaxdata.com)
##### March 2018
Different provisions of the federal tax code are beneficial (or costly) to taxpayers based on where they live and their income. The state and local income tax (SLIT) refund, for example, saves money for almost everyone in high-tax places like New York, while the capital gains provision is a boon to rich people everywhere. SearchTaxData is a web app to explore the effect of any provision across both of these dimensions.
