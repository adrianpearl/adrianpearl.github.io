			WayCount is a Tomorrow Lab-developed traffic counting platform that I got to work on to gage its feasibility for counting bike traffic in addition to cars. Initially my work consisted of testing with both a simulator and real bike traffic. When I discovered that the WayCount’s hardware wasn’t sensitive enough to detect most bikes, I made minor tweaks to its circuitry to improve detection and speed measurement without compromising its excellent battery life.

			After verifying on the oscilloscope that bicycle wheels were being properly detected, I collected more data from outdoor testing and looked at how well the WayCount’s algorithms were interpreting the raw data as passing bicycles. I also collected and closely analyzed data collected from cars to pinpoint errors in speed measurement or vehicle classification that helped to inform Firmware revisioning.
