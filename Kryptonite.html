			Last year, three friends and I took on a project sponsored by 
			<a id="link" href="http://kryptonitelock.com">Kryptonite</a>, a worldwide leader 
			in action sports security, for our senior capstone project at Johns Hopkins.
			Our goal, essentially, was to make the bicycle lock easier to use. The biggest 
			improvement we could aim for, we agreed, was to design a lock that could be 
			used easily with one hand and one continuous motion.
			
			</br></br>
			
			While I'm unable to discuss details of our design, on this page I'll talk
			a bit about my role in the design process and the skills I picked up along 
			the way.
			
			<sectionHead>What <i>is</i> a bike lock?</sectionHead>
			
			If you distill the idea of a lock down to its fundamentals, you realize 
			that even the most basic lock needs three things:
			
			<ul>
			
				<li><em>A credential.</em> This is the information that proves you are the 
				rightful owner of the bike that the lock is protecting. In a standard lock, this information is coded into a key, in the form of the exact shapes and sizes of regions along its surface. In any case, the credential is always something you <i>have</i> (a key), something you <i>are</i> (biometric identification), or something you <i>know</i> (a password). </li> 
				
				<li><em>A gatekeeper.</em> Every lock needs some mechanism to determine who 
				has the real credential and who is just an impostor. In a pin-and-tumbler lock, 
				the gate keeper is a series of spring-loaded pins that each have to be depressed 
				to the correct position to allow rotation of the lock's inner cylinder. The 
				gatekeeper is usually coupled to the credential - if the credential is a 
				fingerprint, the gatekeeper is probably a fingerprint sensor!</li>
				
				<li><em>A gate (opener).</em> The lock needs a physical object blocking the path to the bike, and some way to open it provided only by the gatekeeper. The gate is almost always a thick piece of hardened steel called a deadbolt. On a standard lock, the gate opener is a twisting motion provided by the user once the key is inserted. If you have an electronic lock, your gate opener is probably some kind of motor or linear actuator.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<sectionHead>Two design paths</sectionHead>
			
			Early on in the project, the team decided there were two possible ways we could 
			go about this:
			
			<ol>
				<li>The first was to completely redesign the lock, starting with its 
					most intricate mechanisms all the way up through its shape and user interface. Could we reinvent the key so that it could be inserted more easily, without holding the lock for stability? What about a key that didn't require a twisting motion once inserted?</li>
				<li>The second was to keep the lock's form factor mostly the same but replace its credential, gatekeeper, and gate opener with electronics.  </li>
			</ol>
			
			We determined that initially, both design paths were worth exploring. My friend Alex 
			and I agreed to spend the majority of our time on the second design path, so we 
			started looking at prior work in this area and brainstorming concepts.

    			<figcaption>Early prototyping involved testing different wireless communication paradigms and energy sources. We explored solar power, a rechargeable battery, and a single, rugged battery with an ultra-low power circuit.</figcaption>
			</figure> 						
			
			Since we wanted to make prototypes with both form and function resembling that of an actual electronic lock, the arduinos were just too big. So, I learned the basics of programming AVRs and started using them in our prototypes. This was a daunting task since I had never before learned to program microcontrollers, but in a week or two I knew how to flash ATTiny's and take advantage of their EEPROM, a bunch of their timers, sleep modes/interrupts, and a few other capabilities. I was also learning more about circuit design and clever ways to use transistors to save power.

			As I said before, one of our goals was to keep the form factor of a bike lock mostly the same. There were a couple reasons for this. The first was that we wanted to make the process more like a scientific experiment, where typically only one variable is changed at a time. If we did end up making a lock easier to use, we wanted to be sure it was because of the embedded electronic system we had designed, and not some other change to the lock. The second reason was that it made prototyping more efficient and iterating much faster. For most of our early prototypes, we were able to 3D print housings similar to what you would find in a standard lock, cut a tube of acrylic, and stuff our circuits inside.

			One of the most rewarding parts of this project was making prototypes out of metal near the end, because it allowed us to learn about more advanced manufacturing processes and make something that actually resembled a real bike lock. Below is a picture of us using electrical discharge machining to replicate the shape of a standard U-bolt shackle.
